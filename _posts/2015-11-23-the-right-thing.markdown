 People always say " it is the right thing to do." " I hope we made the best choice"

# But what is the right thing?

 I met a friend, who is a super rich lawyer. He told me that he did all the right things so he's got what he has now.

 But in fact, I am not too sure that he is very happy. Being rich only makes him look sad and lonely, maybe. I can see from the arts work he collected.

 Health? I think it is a luxury. Love? I think is also what you can't buy.

 Interestedly, when I am travelling, or even revisiting London, I see things that I want and don't want in my life.

 So what is the right thing to do?
