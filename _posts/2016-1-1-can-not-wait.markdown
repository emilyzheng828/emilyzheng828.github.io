This is also what I've figured out in 2015, that there is actually no meaning of life at all.

What happend in 2015? Here are some highlights:

1. Letting go things that I don't need
  - Three bags 30 kg charity bags of clothes, shoes and bags
  - Sports that I only tried but did not put more efforts afterwards
  - 7am to 11pm working style
  - Past happiness
  
2. Making new friends
  - People with down to earth attitudes in life
  - People never stopped learning new things
  - People that are so strong after ups and downs in their life
  - People that are open minded and care about others
  - Amazing people in general

3. Having started my nomad life
  - 6 + months  
  - no home but actually many homes


What have I learnt?

- Letting go is not easy but you have to do it
- Less is more
- Have fun in life is so important
- Energy and time are limited, so focus them in the right things you want.
- We are in control of our lives.
  
I can't wait for more new advantures in 2016. Really, I am very looking forward to it.
