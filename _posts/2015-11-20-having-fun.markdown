  Ask yourself what do you enjoy most and go for it. Doodle something on the paper, sing a song, do some sports or learn something new. Be a child, stay curious.

  I found a way to talk to my codes now, as if I am talking to my computer, well, after so many years.

If you can't, quit and do somehting else.

You have to enjoy the crew there otherwise, really, keep looking for the right crowd.
