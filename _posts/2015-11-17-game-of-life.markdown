You are what you build
======================
Somehow, slowly, I started to believe that codes have life. Like when we plant a seed in the soil,it will grow, little by little. What we need here?

#Stay focus

You are typing, but maybe your mind is not here. It happens a lot, isn't it? A very focused person will learn things quickly, as he will watch how people do it, generate idea, practice and finally get there. What can happend if you are not focused enough?

* You code can smell 

Code smell, also known as bad smell, in computer programming code, refers to any symptom in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem. According to Martin Fowler, "a code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system".

* You are wasting your time

"Hey, how much time do you got?" Although time is a relative defination we created, but have you ever seriously considered how much time do you have? So if a decision has been made to do something, why not focus more? If not, follow the next step

* Better do something else

You don't have to do what you are doing right now, if you are suffering from it. Don't complain, just do something else. Only if you know how
