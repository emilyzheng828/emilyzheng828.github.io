Max ia a new born baby. She should be special as her father is Mark Zukerberg, founder of facebook.

No matter if this is a PR event or an excited moment for a dad, his letter to Max is showing a parent with power.
'We will give 99% of our Facebook shars - currently about $45 billion during our lives to join many others in improving this world for the next generation.'

How many parents can say this? I am glad they did, as a powerful parent, they are trying to do something good proactively.

On the other hand, I wish that Max can have a normal life. ' A new politician was born!', as one of my friends quoted. I hope she won't live under huge pressure and extremely high expectations from this Jewish father and a Asian tiger mom.

Enjoy life Max. 

And please tell your parent that keep some deseases on earth, as we all need to die one day.

#Vim learning today
How to show, set and reset vim's variables:

- **:set** shows vars different from defaults
- **:set all** all values
- **:set foo?** shows the value of foo
- **:setlocal foo** only the current buffer
- **verbose set foo?** tells you where it was last set!
