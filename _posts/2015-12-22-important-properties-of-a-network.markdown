title: "Important properties of a Network"
---
1. Scope 
A network architecture should be designed to support both a wide range of applications and a wide range of underlying technologies.

2. Scalability 
The ideal network design would work well with very large networks and also be efficient with small networks.

3. Robustness
A network should continue to operate even if nodes or links fail.
