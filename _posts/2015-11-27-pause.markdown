Hey, can I ask you to **Pause**? 

Or, can you pause? I mean stop anything that you are doing right now? Typing? Thinking? Eating? Working? Drinking? Talking? Travelling? Being busy?

Can you pause for a second as if you are a robot being unplugged or switched off for a second?

I am not asking more, just **one second**!

I am pretty sure that it is not easy to do. At least for me, it is hard. But I am trying to learn to pause, in life.

Being busy is good, but we also need time to have a moment to think. There is no rush to do anything, to finish my Ruby Koans, finish a roman numeral kata, to travel from one place to another or to finish a course. We need to learn to pause and understand something we don't understand, we need a moment for our thoughts to grow, we need to be patient.

Try to pause for a moment, then refocus!
