title: "What is mastery?"
---

I just noticed that there is no end in the mastery journey. **Mastery is practice**

Even for someone with years of experiences. 

The Five master keys:

1. Instruction 

Being in the hands of a master teacher.

2. Practice

"How do you get to Carnegie Hall?"
"Practice"

3. Surrender 

Surrendering to your teacher and to the demands of your discipline.

4. Intentionality

Willpower, attitude - it is a mental game.

5. The Edge

Before enligtenment, chop wood and carry water.

After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.
