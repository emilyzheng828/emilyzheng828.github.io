#What shall we do if we fail?

At least, don't blame yourself. Blame yourself if you did not try, try again, again and again.

As again is also 'A gain.'

It took me 3 whole weeks to finish RubyKoans
the first time. I blamed myself too much at the beginning, as in why I can't
figure out something very simple? Am I too stupid for this? Am I wasting my time and other people's time?

Well, how did I face the down moment at the end? The first time I bumped into 'Me being stupid" situation (fortunately it did not last too long), is to step away from the situation for a few hours, do something fun and refresh myself, then come back to the problem. 

Do something that makes you feel good: massage, music, nice food...or even a haircut.
Also do something that you are good at will make you feel confident again. Once your energy is back, conquer the problem.

Anyway, I am doing rubykoans the second time now. 3 hours for 100 koan tasks. Not bad, right? This means that once you sovle a problem, the problem itself becomes something that can make you feel good and proud. Next time, if I face another problem, I might just do Rubykoans again, because we can always find answers from the very basic or get my conficence back.

So, really, don't blame yourself if you fail, blame yourself if you did not give it another try, again and again, for anything in life.
