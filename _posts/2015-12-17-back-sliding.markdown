title: "back-sliding"

When you climb the hill, can you maintain the same speed? It is difficult right?

I feel it these days, and I am a bit scare of back-sliding. Like as if you stopped progressing, lost the speed you had before.

I am asking myself exactly the same question:

Where will I get the energy for my journey? What pitfalls will I encounter along the path? 

How can I apply mastery to the commonplace things of life?

I just realised that things can't be done easily within a short time. I have a long way to go. 

#Tools for mastery
1. Be aware of the way homeostasis works.
2. Be willing to negotiate with your resistance to change.
3. Develop a support system.
4. Follow a regular practice.
5. Dedicate yourself to lifelong learning.
