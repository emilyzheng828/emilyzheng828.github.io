title: "Failing a driving test"
---

A failing in reality. I failed my driving test the second time this morning.

Reason? <br>
- Nervousness

Again, I have no idea why this thing keeps coming back. Why we always let the fear take over our knowledge
- Lack of practice <br>

This failure is a little bit of ' go there and wing it' or ' If I pass, great' attitude!

I complained a bit about the test centre as it is a new one that I haven't tried before. It is an area considered a bit difficult than my normal one. But as my instructor replied: it is not about the test centre, it is you. You should pass any of them no matter what.

How do I face this failure?

I book the test again, and I am going to do it again. 

Maybe, in reality, we can apply TDD to our life as well. We are seeking for the red then make it green.

So whatever you are doing, if you fail, don't be afaid. Go back and check what is wrong then fix it. Be patient. Practice more!

Make it green!
