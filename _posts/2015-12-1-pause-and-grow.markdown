One needs to digest every eperience to have the maximum effect. Otherwise, too many experiences may have no effect at all.

For a blueberry tree to grow, sometimes we have to get rid of the flowers or cut the top branches to make sure it is growing more branches and leaves. It might be a good choice to have no fruits at all. 5 years later, we have some better blueberries. Be patient!

˜You have to take time to smell the roses', meaning in life you have to enjoy as well. Sometimes, 'wasted time' is the most productive time if we need to be creative. We can be in this creative status only if our mind is free and relaxed.

Make a plan, and let the plan wor for itself, in the meantime, 'find the time to smell the rose!'

#Vim learning today

- *:substitute* conmand searches for a text pattern, and replaces it with a text string

- *:%s/foo/bar/g* Find each occurrence of 'foo' in all lines and replace it with 'bar'

- *:s/foo/bar* Find each occurrence of ˜foo' in the current line only, and replace it with 'bar'

- *:%s/foo/bar/gc* Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.
