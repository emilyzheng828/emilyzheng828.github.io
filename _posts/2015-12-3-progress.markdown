#How to check your own progress?

I am sure that you will feel the difference, at lease I do. Even people surround me are giving me some positive feedback. My coach at codebar mentioned last night that 'I feel that you have dramatic progress since the first time I coached you." 

Do you know how happy I am to hear this? **SUPER EPIC!**

Anyway, I am glad that I am in the right direction. The only thing I need to do is to keep it up.

Another thing to check your progress is constantly asking yourself, *Are you happy what you are doing at the moment?*

**YES** Then go ahead, that is what I am doing!

#Vim learning today:

To indent the current line, or a visual block: <br>
  - **ctrl-t**, ctrl-d - indent current line forward, backwards(insert mode)<br>
  - **visual > or <**  - indent block by sw (repeat with .)
