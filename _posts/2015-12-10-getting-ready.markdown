title: "Am I ready?"

Ruby Kata performance at 8th light is counting down. I am a bit nervous to do it in front of everyone. 

The only thing I did these days are: creating a roman numeral file, writing test, creating failure test, making it green, refactoring the current code and deleting the file.

Then, start again.

This is called practice. But most of the time, the so called 'in the zone' is really difficult to achieve. We have things in mind, I am thinking about the driving test I am having on Monday, the meeting I am going to have with my friends, the jokes people are telling in the office, the donuts on the table and plenty coffee times...

I am thinking about the prison again. The peaceful zone area...

But do I need to go there? Who is actually in control? It is ourselves, it should not be the enviroment. 

#Vim learning today
*not sure I will remember this one right now*

Using tags makes it easier to jump to certain parts of your programs. First run ctags from the UNIX command line on your source files (e.g., ctags prog.c or ctags -R to recurse) to generate a "tags" file, then use these while editing your source files:

 :tag TAB            - list the known tags
 :tag function_name  - jump to that function
 ctrl-t   - goes to previous spot where you called :tag
 ctrl-]   - calls :tag on the word under the cursor        
 :ptag    - open tag in preview window (also ctrl-w })
 :pclose  - close preview window
