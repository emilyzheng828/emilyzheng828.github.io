title: "Mastery"

Do I want to become a master one day? Be good at what I am doing?

We all aspire to mastery, but the path is always long and sometimes rocky, and it promised no quick and easy payoffs.

I FEEL IT!

Also trying to figure out if I am a **dabbler**
A dabbler approaches each new thing, career opportunity or relationship with enormous enthusiasm. He or she loves to try new things:
- Not focused enough
- Can't wait for new challenges
- Easily distracted by new opportunities
- Never finish one thing in his/her life 
- Eventually, he or she will give up and do something else

Again, I am doing a self-analysis here, to see what I can change to make sure that I am on track with any practices in life.

Am I a dabbler ? Can I finish this challenge? How about the next one? What about next year? Am I committing myself fully, even towards the next 5 years?

I think I have the answer, in my heart.

Stay focused, keep doing the little things.
