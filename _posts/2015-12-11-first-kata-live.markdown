title: "Live Kata"
---

Alright, today is the day. 

Can't believe that I am with 8th light for 3 months now. The Kata is like a term exam for me, for what I have learnt, what I have gained.

It is not only the kata, it if far too much than that.

I was out in the morning for some driving lesson, no time for warming up then go straight to the live performance. A bit scary if I think about it now. To be honest, to perform a kata in front of everyone is HARD! I was nervous, so nervous. Mis-spelling, forgot to breathe and also, I had this 'nothing in my mind' moment, which means, something went wrong and I had no idea what happened.

What have saved me ? A deep breathe to take me back to the present. The many many times typing from before that makes my fingers typing something out without thinking.

Anyway, here is my [roman numeral kata in ruby](https://vimeo.com/148644585) 

I want to do more performance now, to get rid of the nervous. The only way to get rid of what I am scared of is to face it. Do it again and again until I am not scared at all.


#Vim learning today
word & line completion

Typing is a pain! In insert mode, try:

ctrl-n, ctrl-p    - next/previous word completion 
                    (similar word in current file)

ctrl-x ctrl-l (ctrl-n/p)    - line completion

:set dictionary=/usr/share/dict/words
ctrl-x ctrl-k     - dictionary completion
also

ctrl-w      - erases word (insert mode...
ctrl-u      - erases line  ...or on command line)
